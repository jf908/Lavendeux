# Lavendeux [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rscarson/Lavendeux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rscarson/Lavendeux)

#### [Installer and binaries](http://rscarson.github.io/lavendeux/)

### Lavendeux enhances the clipboard
Lavendeux inlines calculating, programming and testing utilities into your favourite text editor.

Test the result of a remote API call, check the result of a regular expression and much more, all without needing to break your workflow.

Currently, Lavendeux is Windows only, but Linux and OSX releases are coming shortly - if you are an OSX user interested in Lavendeux, please feel free to contact me.

#### How to use it
Highlight an expression, and press control space; Lavendeux will replace it with the answer.

Or, alternatively, turn auto copy/paste off in the menu, and CTRL-Space will instead solve any expressions in your clipboard.

The parser itself is also available as a separate crate - [lavendeux-parser](https://crates.io/crates/lavendeux-parser)

It also supports a few command line options:

- config: Change the configuration directory (defaults to ~/.lavendeux)
- log-level: Change the logging level - useful for debugging issues (defaults to warning)

#### Extensions
Extend Lavendeux's featureset with [extensions](http://rscarson.github.io/Lavendeux/extensions). Extensions are written in javascript, sandboxed environment, with no network or host access.
